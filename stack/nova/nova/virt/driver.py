class ComputeDriver(object):
    """Base class for compute drivers.

    The interface to this class talks in terms of 'instances' (Amazon EC2 and
    internal Nova terminology), by which we mean 'running virtual machine'
    (XenAPI terminology) or domain (Xen or libvirt terminology).

    An instance has an ID, which is the identifier chosen by Nova to represent
    the instance further up the stack.  This is unfortunately also called a
    'name' elsewhere.  As far as this layer is concerned, 'instance ID' and
    'instance name' are synonyms.

    Note that the instance ID or name is not human-readable or
    customer-controlled -- it's an internal ID chosen by Nova.  At the
    nova.virt layer, instances do not have human-readable names at all -- such
    things are only known higher up the stack.

    Most virtualization platforms will also have their own identity schemes,
    to uniquely identify a VM or domain.  These IDs must stay internal to the
    platform-specific layer, and never escape the connection interface.  The
    platform-specific layer is responsible for keeping track of which instance
    ID maps to which platform-specific ID, and vice versa.

    In contrast, the list_disks and list_interfaces calls may return
    platform-specific IDs.  These identify a specific virtual disk or specific
    virtual network interface, and these IDs are opaque to the rest of Nova.

    Some methods here take an instance of nova.compute.service.Instance.  This
    is the datastructure used by nova.compute to store details regarding an
    instance, and pass them into this layer.  This layer is responsible for
    translating that generic datastructure into terms that are specific to the
    virtualization platform.
