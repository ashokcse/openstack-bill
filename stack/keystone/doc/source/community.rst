Getting Involved

The Keystone community is a very friendly group and there are places online to join in with the 
community. Feel free to ask questions. This document points you to some of the places where you can
communicate with people.

How to Join the Community
=========================

Our community welcomes all people interested in open source cloud computing, and there are no formal
membership requirements. The best way to join the community is to talk with others online or at a meetup
and offer contributions through Launchpad_, the wiki_, or blogs. We welcome all types of contributions,
from blueprint designs to documentation to testing to deployment scripts.
