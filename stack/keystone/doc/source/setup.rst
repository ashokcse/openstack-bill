===============================================
Setting up a Keystone a development environment
===============================================

This document describes setting up keystone directly from GitHub_
for development purposes.

To install keystone from packaging, refer instead to Keystone's `User Documentation`_.

.. _GitHub: http://github.com/openstack/keystone
.. _`User Documentation`: http://docs.openstack.org/

Prerequisites
=============

This document assumes you are using:

- Ubuntu 11.10, Fedora 15, or Mac OS X Lion
- `Python 2.7`_

.. _`Python 2.7`: http://www.python.org/

And that you have the following tools available on your system:

- git_
- setuptools_
- pip_

**Reminder**: If you're successfully using a different platform, or a
different version of the above, please document your configuration here!

.. _git: http://git-scm.com/
.. _setuptools: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools

Installing dependencies
=======================

Keystone maintains a list of PyPi_ dependencies, designed for use by
pip_.

.. _PyPi: http://pypi.python.org/
.. _pip: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip

However, your system *may* need additional dependencies that `pip` (and by
extension, PyPi) cannot satisfy. These dependencies should be installed
prior to using `pip`, and the installation method may vary depending on
your platform.

Ubuntu 11.10::

    $ sudo apt-get install python-dev libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libsasl2-dev libsqlite3-dev libssl-dev libldap2-dev

Fedora 15::

    $ sudo yum install python-sqlite2 python-lxml python-greenlet-devel python-ldap

Mac OS X Lion (requires MacPorts_)::

    $ sudo port install py-ldap

.. _MacPorts: http://www.macports.org/

PyPi Packages
-------------

Assuming you have any necessary binary packages & header files available
on your system, you can then install PyPi dependencies.

You may also need to prefix `pip install` with `sudo`, depending on your
environment::

    # Describe dependencies (including non-PyPi dependencies)
    $ cat tools/pip-requires

    # Install all PyPi dependencies (for production, testing, and development)
    $ pip install -r tools/pip-requires

Updating your PYTHONPATH
========================

There are a number of methods for getting Keystone into your PYTHON PATH,
the easiest of which is::

    # Fake-install the project by symlinking Keystone into your Python site-packages
    $ python setup.py develop

You should then be able to `import keystone` from your Python shell
without issue::

    >>> import keystone
    >>>

If you can import keystone successfully, you should be ready to move on to :doc:`testing`.

Troubleshooting
===============

Eventlet segfaults on RedHat / Fedora
-------------------------------------

[*If this is no longer an issue, please remove this section, thanks!*]

On some OSes, specifically Fedora 15, the current versions of
greenlet/eventlet segfault when running keystone. To fix this, install
the development versions of greenlet and eventlet::

    $ pip uninstall greenlet eventlet
    $ cd <appropriate working directory>
    $ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/ambroff/greenlet
    $ cd greenlet
    $ sudo python setup.py install

    $ cd <appropriate working directory>
    $ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/which_linden/eventlet
    $ cd greenlet
    $ sudo python setup.py install
