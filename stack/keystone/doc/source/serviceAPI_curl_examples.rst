The service API is defined to be a subset of the Admin API and, by
default, runs on port 5000.

GET /
=====

This call is identical to that documented for the Admin API, except
that it uses port 5000, instead of port 35357, by default::

    $ curl http://0.0.0.0:5000

or::

    $ curl http://0.0.0.0:5000/v2.0/

See the `Admin API Examples Using Curl`_ for more info.
