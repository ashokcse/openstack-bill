Configuring Keystone
====================

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   keystone.conf
   man/keystone-manage

Once Keystone is installed, it needs to be configured with any services
that will be using Keystone, and those services need to be provided with
service tokens to be able to use Keystone to authenticate users.

Setting up keystone credentials
===============================

The roles that are defined by default in the :doc:`keystone.conf` file are::

    #Role that allows to perform admin operations.
    keystone-admin-role = KeystoneAdmin

    #Role that allows to perform service admin operations.
    keystone-service-admin-role = KeystoneServiceAdmin

Once configured, users and tenants need to be defined so that other OpenStack
systems may authenticate against them. For the keystone service itself, two
Roles are pre-defined in the keystone configuration file
(:doc:`keystone.conf`).

These roles still need to be created using :doc:`man/keystone-manage`
commands to be able to use them::

    $> keystone-manage user add admin secrete
    $> keystone-manage role add KeystoneAdmin
    $> keystone-manage role add KeystoneServiceAdmin
    $> keystone-manage role grant KeystoneAdmin admin
    $> keystone-manage role grant KeystoneServiceAdmin admin

Once these are defined, you should now have the choice of using the
administrative API (as well as the :doc:`man/keystone-manage` commands) to
further configure keystone. There are a number of examples of how to use
that API at :doc:`adminAPI_curl_examples`.

Setting up service endpoints
============================

Defining an Administrative Service Token
########################################

An Administrative Service Token is a bit of arbitrary text which is configured
in Keystone and used (typically configured into) Nova, Swift, Glance, and any
other OpenStack projects, to be able to use Keystone services.

This token is an arbitrary text string, but must be identical between Keystone
and the services using Keystone. This token is bound to a user and tenant as
well, so those also need to be created prior to setting it up.

The *admin* user was set up above, but we haven't created a tenant for that
user yet::

    $> keystone-manage tenant add admin

and while we're here, let's grant the admin user the 'Admin' role to the
'admin' tenant::

    $> keystone-manage role add Admin
    $> keystone-manage role grant Admin admin admin

Now we can create a service token::

    $> keystone-manage token add 999888777666 admin admin 2015-02-05T00:00

This creates a service token of '999888777666' associated to the admin user,
admin tenant, and expires on February 5th, 2015. This token will be used when
configuring Nova, Glance, or other OpenStack services.

Defining Services and Service Endpoints
#######################################

Keystone also acts as a service catalog to let other OpenStack systems know
where relevant API endpoints exist for OpenStack Services. The OpenStack
Dashboard, in particular, uses this heavily - and this **must** be configured
for the OpenStack Dashboard to properly function.

Here's how we define the services::

    $> keystone-manage service add nova compute "Nova Compute Service"
    $> keystone-manage service add glance image "Glance Image Service"
    $> keystone-manage service add swift storage "Swift Object Storage Service"
    $> keystone-manage service add keystone identity "Keystone Identity Service"

Once the services are defined, we create endpoints for them. Each service
has three relevant URL's associated with it that are used in the command:

* the public API URL
* an administrative API URL
* an internal URL

The "internal URL" is a pointer to the same endpoint as the public API URL,
but enabled for deployments which are using a private network to communicate
between OpenStack components - where the 'public facing' API may not be
available.

An example of setting up the endpoint for Nova::

    $> keystone-manage endpointTemplates add RegionOne nova \
    http://nova-api.mydomain:8774/v1.1/%tenant_id% \
    http://nova-api.mydomain:8774/v1.1/%tenant_id% \
    http://nova-api.mydomain:8774/v1.1/%tenant_id% \
    1 1

Glance::

    $> keystone-manage endpointTemplates add RegionOne glance \
    http://glance.mydomain:9292/v1 \
    http://glance.mydomain:9292/v1 \
    http://glance.mydomain:9292/v1 \
    1 1

Swift::

    $> keystone-manage endpointTemplates add RegionOne swift \
    http://swift.mydomain:8080/v1/AUTH_[TENANT_ID] \
    http://swift.mydomain:8080/v1.0/ \
    http://swift.mydomain:8080/v1/AUTH_[TENANT_ID] \
    1 1

And setting up an endpoint for Keystone::

    $> keystone-manage endpointTemplates add RegionOne keystone \
    http://keystone.mydomain:5000/v2.0 \
    http://keystone.mydomain:35357/v2.0 \
    http://keystone.mydomain:5000/v2.0 \
    1 1


Setting up OpenStack users
==========================

Creating Tenants, Users, and Roles
##################################

Let's set up a 'demo' tenant::

    $> keystone-manage tenant add demo

And add a 'demo' user with the password 'guest'::

    $> keystone-manage user add demo guest

Now let's add a role of "Member" and grant 'demo' user that role
as it pertains to the tenant 'demo'::

    $> keystone-manage role add Member
    $> keystone-manage role grant Member demo demo

Let's also add the admin user as an Admin role to the demo tenant::

    $> keystone-manage role grant Admin admin demo

Creating EC2 credentials
########################

To add EC2 credentials for the `admin` and `demo` accounts::

    $> keystone-manage credentials add admin EC2 'admin' 'secretpassword'
    $> keystone-manage credentials add admin EC2 'demo' 'secretpassword'

If you have a large number of credentials to create, you can put them all
into a single large file and import them using :doc:`man/keystone-import`. The
format of the document looks like::

    credentials add admin EC2 'username' 'password'
    credentials add admin EC2 'username' 'password'

Then use::

    $> keystone-import `filename`

Configuring Nova to use Keystone
################################

To configure Nova to use Keystone for authentication, the Nova API service
can be run against the api-paste file provided by Keystone. This is most
easily accomplished by setting the `--api_paste_config` flag in nova.conf to
point to `examples/paste/nova-api-paste.ini` from Keystone. This paste file
included references to the WSGI authentication middleware provided with the
keystone installation.

When configuring Nova, it is important to create a admin service token for
the service (from the Configuration step above) and include that as the key
'admin_token' in the nova-api-paste.ini. See the documented
:doc:`nova-api-paste` file for references.

Configuring Swift to use Keystone
#################################

Similar to Nova, swift can be configured to use Keystone for authentication
rather than it's built in 'tempauth'.

1. Add a service endpoint for Swift to Keystone

2. Configure the paste file for swift-proxy (`/etc/swift/swift-proxy.conf`)

3.  Reconfigure Swift's proxy server to use Keystone instead of TempAuth.
    Here's an example `/etc/swift/proxy-server.conf`::

        [DEFAULT]
        bind_port = 8888
        user = <user>

        [pipeline:main]
        pipeline = catch_errors cache keystone proxy-server

        [app:proxy-server]
        use = egg:swift#proxy
        account_autocreate = true

        [filter:keystone]
        use = egg:keystone#tokenauth
        auth_protocol = http
        auth_host = 127.0.0.1
        auth_port = 35357
        admin_token = 999888777666
        delay_auth_decision = 0
        service_protocol = http
        service_host = 127.0.0.1
        service_port = 8100
        service_pass = dTpw

        [filter:cache]
        use = egg:swift#memcache
        set log_name = cache

        [filter:catch_errors]
        use = egg:swift#catch_errors

4. Restart swift

5. Verify that keystone is providing authentication to Swift

Use `swift` to check everything works (note: you currently have to create a
container or upload something as your first action to have the account
created; there's a Swift bug to be fixed soon)::

    $ swift -A http://127.0.0.1:5000/v1.0 -U joeuser -K secrete post container
    $ swift -A http://127.0.0.1:5000/v1.0 -U joeuser -K secrete stat -v
    StorageURL: http://127.0.0.1:8888/v1/AUTH_1234
    Auth Token: 74ce1b05-e839-43b7-bd76-85ef178726c3
    Account: AUTH_1234
    Containers: 1
    Objects: 0
    Bytes: 0
    Accept-Ranges: bytes
    X-Trans-Id: tx25c1a6969d8f4372b63912f411de3c3b

.. WARNING::
    Keystone currently allows any valid token to do anything with any account.
