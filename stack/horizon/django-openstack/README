OpenStack Django-Nova
---------------------

The Django-Nova project is a Django module that is used to provide web based
interactions with the OpenStack Nova cloud controller.

There is a reference implementation that uses this module located at:

    http://launchpad.net/openstack-dashboard

It is highly recommended that you make use of this reference implementation
so that changes you make can be visualized effectively and are consistent.
Using this reference implementation as a development environment will greatly
simplify development of the django-nova module.

Of course, if you are developing your own Django site using django-nova, then
you can disregard this advice.



Getting Started
---------------

Django-Nova uses Buildout (http://www.buildout.org/) to manage local
development.  To configure your local Buildout environment first install the following
system-level dependencies:
  * python-dev
  * git
  * bzr

Then instantiate buildout with

  $ python bootstrap.py
  $ bin/buildout

This will install all the dependencies of django-nova and provide some useful
scripts in the bin/ directory:

  bin/python provides a python shell for the current buildout.
  bin/django provides django functions for the current buildout.


You should now be able to run unit tests as follows:

  $ bin/django test
or
  $ bin/test

You can run unit tests with code coverage on django_openstack by setting
NOSE_WITH_COVERAGE:

  $ NOSE_WITH_COVERAGE=true bin/test

Get even better coverage info by running coverage directly:

  $ coverage run --branch --source django_openstack bin/django test django_openstack && coverage html
