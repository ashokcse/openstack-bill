      <h3>Description:</h3>
      <p>A container is a storage compartment for your data and provides a way for you to organize your data. You can think of a container as a folder in Windows® or a directory in UNIX®. The primary difference between a container and these other file system concepts is that containers cannot be nested. You can, however, create an unlimited number of containers within your account. Data must be stored in a container so you must have at least one container defined in your account prior to uploading data.</p>
