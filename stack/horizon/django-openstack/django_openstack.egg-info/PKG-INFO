Description: OpenStack Django-Nova
        ---------------------
        
        The Django-Nova project is a Django module that is used to provide web based
        interactions with the OpenStack Nova cloud controller.
        
        There is a reference implementation that uses this module located at:
        
            http://launchpad.net/openstack-dashboard
        
        It is highly recommended that you make use of this reference implementation
        so that changes you make can be visualized effectively and are consistent.
        Using this reference implementation as a development environment will greatly
        simplify development of the django-nova module.
        
        Of course, if you are developing your own Django site using django-nova, then
        you can disregard this advice.
        
        
        
        Getting Started
        ---------------
        
        Django-Nova uses Buildout (http://www.buildout.org/) to manage local
        development.  To configure your local Buildout environment first install the following
        system-level dependencies:
          * python-dev
          * git
          * bzr
        
        Then instantiate buildout with
        
          $ python bootstrap.py
          $ bin/buildout
        
        This will install all the dependencies of django-nova and provide some useful
        scripts in the bin/ directory:
        
          bin/python provides a python shell for the current buildout.
          bin/django provides django functions for the current buildout.
        
        
        You should now be able to run unit tests as follows:
        
          $ bin/django test
        or
          $ bin/test
        
        You can run unit tests with code coverage on django_openstack by setting
        NOSE_WITH_COVERAGE:
        
          $ NOSE_WITH_COVERAGE=true bin/test
        
        Get even better coverage info by running coverage directly:
        
          $ coverage run --branch --source django_openstack bin/django test django_openstack && coverage html
