OpenStack Dashboard
-------------------

The OpenStack Dashboard is a reference implementation of a Django site that
uses the Django-Nova project to provide web based interactions with the
OpenStack Nova cloud controller.


Getting Started
---------------

For local development, first create a virtualenv for local development.
A tool is included to create one for you:

  $ python tools/install_venv.py


Now that the virtualenv is created, you need to configure your local
environment.  To do this, create a local_settings.py file in the local/
directory.  There is a local_settings.py.example file there that may be used
as a template.

Finally, issue the django syncdb command:

  $ tools/with_venv.sh dashboard/manage.py syncdb

If after you have specified the admin user the script appears to hang, it
probably means the installation of Nova being referred to in local_settings.py
is unavailable.


If all is well you should now able to run the server locally:

  $ tools/with_venv.sh dashboard/manage.py runserver

Adding openstackx Extensions to Nova
------------------------------------

If you are seeing large numbers of 404 exceptions on operations such as listing
servers, you are probably not running the openstackx extensions that the
dashboard depends on.  You will need to download the openstackx code from

> https://github.com/cloudbuilders/openstackx

and add the following option to your nova instantiation:

> --osapi_extensions_path=/path/to/openstackx/extensions

The rackspace cloudbuilders nova.sh script automates this process and creates a
full nova installation compatible with the dashboard.  You can acquire this
script from the repository at

https://github.com/cloudbuilders/deploy.sh
