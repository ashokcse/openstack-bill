Short Term:

- Test normal arrays vs TypedArrays vs imageData arrays.
    - Blog post about it.

- VNC performance and regression playback suite.
    - WebSockets
        - expand latency test
        - add absolute timers (every 500 packets)
        - try 1 ms delay
        - stop at 4000 packets
        - small and large packets test

    - JavaScript
        - just base64 decode
        - everything except Canvas

    - Full test
        - Without WebSockets
        - With replay from python tester
        - add higher-resolution multi test

    - websockify test with echo and playback functionality
      - choosen by client test page on connect


- Keyboard layout/internationalization support
    - convert keyCode into proper charCode

- IE 9 improvements.
    - https://github.com/gimite/web-socket-js/issues#issue/41
    - try window.atob instead of decode for better performance

- Status bar menu/buttons:
    - Explanatory hover text over buttons

    - Configuration menu:
        - Tunable: speed vs. bandwidth selection
        - Tunable: CPU use versus latency.
        - Scaling

    - Keyboard menu:
        - Ctrl Lock, Alt Lock, SysRq Lock
        - Highlight menu icon when keys are locked

    - Clipboard button -> popup:
        - text, clear and send buttons

Medium Term:

- Viewport support

- Touchscreen testing/support.
